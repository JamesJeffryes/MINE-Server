=head2 SYNOPSIS

The MINE database is fundamentally composed of two different types of documents, which are represented by the Compound
and Reaction objects. Users can use text-matching queries to access these records directly or perform two types of more
advanced queries: Mass Adduct queries and pathway queries. Mass Adduct queries return a list of compounds that might
match the m/z of an unknown compound. Pathway queries return either the shortest path or all paths between two compounds
 in the database.
