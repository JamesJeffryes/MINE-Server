=head1 NAME

Bio::KBase::mine_database::Client

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 mineDatabaseServices

=head2 SYNOPSIS

The MINE database is fundamentally composed of two different types of documents, which are represented by the Compound
and Reaction objects. Users can use text-matching queries to access these records directly or perform two types of more
advanced queries: Mass Adduct queries and pathway queries. Mass Adduct queries return a list of compounds that might
match the m/z of an unknown compound. Pathway queries return either the shortest path or all paths between two compounds
 in the database.

=item Description

Data structures for a reaction object

                Guaranteed:
                object_id id - A hexdigest of the sha1 hash of the _ids of the reactants and products in sorted order
        list<string> Operators - The operator used to generate a particular reaction
        rxn_comps Reactants - Reactants of the reaction as tuples
        rxn_comps Products - Products of the reaction as tuples

        Optionally:
        float Energy - Delta G of reaction calculated by group contribution theory
        float Error - Estimated error of above energy
